# Decoder Ring

## Description
The goal of this project was to build an application that encodes and decodes messages. 

## Background
Within the app, the polybius square, caesar shift, and substitution cipher were used as different methods of encoding and decoding user messages. The caesar shift shifts all characters a specified number of characters to the right to encode. The polybius square translates characters to numbers. Lastly, the substitution cipher uses a mixed alphabet to encode messages. 

## Features

The prior methods of encoding and decoding messages are the main features within this app.
